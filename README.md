This project is also old. I do not maintain it. You can try it, but I know lots of the functionality doesnt work as well as it does not support the latest server versions. If you want a minecraft server, just go to https://www.idtech.com/blog/creating-minecraft-server


INSTALLING

Download repository zip by going to code --> download zip. Or by going to this link (https://codeload.github.com/importshark/servermanipulator/zip/refs/heads/main)
Once it is downloaded run the installer file.
Follow installer prompts

SETTINGS

find settings.bat
right click and press edit
set minimum and maximum ram
the next option is for the gui that opens up when you run the server

INFO

Any errors will instantly send you to a screen and crash. Dont worry!
To fix,
1. Use common sense (The server propbably wont run if it is nonexistent, right?)
